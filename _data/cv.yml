    - title: Software Engineer
      institution: Chubb, Hyderabad, India
      year: July 2023 – Aug 2024
      description:
        - Architected and implemented the entire backend infrastructure of a product recommender system using FastAPI to generate 100+ personalized assets (eg. taglines and images) through LLMs, increasing campaign engagement by 25%
        - Designed and implemented SQL-based workflows to create, clone, and manage prompt templates, supporting structured storage and retrieval of prompt configurations and generated outputs.
        - Designed a concurrency management wrapper that improved Databricks job throughput by 30% in high load periods.
        - Developed a real-time monitoring system for travel policies, enabling risk based alerting with 1min latency, reducing incident response time by 60%
        - Integrated machine learning models to develop dynamic pricing strategies, enabling real-time price surging.
        - Streamlined deployment processes using Docker and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), ensuring seamless, scalable, and reliable cloud-based operations.

    - title: <a href="https://github.com/jishnuwarrier/SpotifyBuddies">SpotifyBuddies - Organic Playlist Recommender</a>
      year: Jan 2025 – May 2025
      description:
        - Built a 40 GB data-prep pipeline (Pandas + SciPy sparse) that merged Million Playlist and Echo Nest datasets, computed 100M+ user–playlist overlaps in minutes, and produced 20M contrastive triplets for model training.
        - Implemented a FastAPI micro-service (multi-stage Docker, uv installer) delivering 1000-user batch recommendations <300ms on CPU, shrinking image size 6GB → 2GB and build time by 85%.
        - Deployed an end-to-end MLOps pipeline on Chameleon Cloud with Terraform & Ansible.

    - title: <a href="https://github.com/jishnuwarrier/EfficientDebates">EfficientDebates - Pruning-Based Multi-Agent Reasoning with Small LLMs</a>
      year: Feb 2025 – May 2025
      description:
        - Designed an adaptive pruning-based multi-agent debate protocol that boosts reasoning accuracy of small LLMs (LLaMA 3B/8B, Phi 3 Mini) on GSM8K to 90.3%, rivaling LLaMA 70B while reducing compute cost by 4.3x.
        - Reduced average inference to 3.27 LLM calls per sample by asynchronously triggering debates only when agents disagree.
        - Benchmarked against Self-Consistency baselines, demonstrating that model diversity and early-exit gating lead to cost-efficient accuracy improvements.

    - title: License Plate Recognition
      year: Jan 2022 – May 2022
      description:
        - Curated and pre-processed a custom dataset of Indian license-plate images; applied augmentation and OpenCV transforms to handle diverse lighting and viewing angles.
        - Built a YOLOv5 detector plus contour-based character segmentation and CNN OCR, topped with a novel rule-based state-code auto-correction layer that significantly boosted end-to-end accuracy.

Hi, Iâ€™m Jishnu ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Masterâ€™s student in Computer Engineering at NYU Tandon, where I focus on building intelligent, scalable systems at the intersection of AI and software engineering. My journey began with an undergraduate degree from BITS Pilani, followed by a year as a Software Engineer at Chubb, where I worked on AI-driven platforms and large-scale backend infrastructure.

Now at NYU, Iâ€™m combining research and engineering â€” exploring how reinforcement learning and large language models can power complex, real-world decision-making. Iâ€™ve also spent time developing deep learning models during my internship at Nanyang Technological University, which gave me early exposure to applying AI to human-centered problems.

I enjoy solving problems that sit at the crossroads of machine learning, distributed systems, and practical applications. Whether itâ€™s deploying production-grade pipelines, optimizing large-scale systems, or experimenting with new ways to make AI more explainable and impactful, Iâ€™m always curious to dive deeper.

I'm a Master's student in Computer Engineering at NYU Tandon with a passion for building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems. Currently working as a Research Assistant at SAI Lab, I'm developing graph-constrained multi-agent reinforcement learning pipelines to accelerate post-disaster electrical grid restoration.

My expertise spans machine learning operations, distributed systems, and full-stack development. At Chubb, I architected backend infrastructure for AI-powered product recommender systems, designed real-time monitoring solutions, and implemented dynamic pricing strategies that increased campaign engagement by 25% and reduced incident response times by 60%.

I enjoy tackling complex technical challenges, from building efficient MLOps pipelines on cloud infrastructure to developing novel multi-agent reasoning systems. My recent projects include [SpotifyBuddies](https://github.com/jishnuwarrier), a playlist recommender with end-to-end MLOps deployment, and [EfficientDebates](https://github.com/jishnuwarrier), a pruning-based approach that achieves 90.3% accuracy on reasoning tasks while reducing compute costs by 4.3x.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring the intersection of AI and practical applications, always looking for ways to make technology more accessible and impactful.
